# Why I love supernotes so much!!!

> ***Written after only using this for about a week***

From someone that has made so many systems in the different apps that I have tried and used, Supernotes keeps me from focusing too much on folders and hierarchy structure. They advertise this **but the fact that they are a company that they stay true to their motto is surprising when it comes to companies advertising**. 

I used to put too much of my time into system theories while testing them out in the app of my choice, that I would neglect notetaking and writing to where the main focus that I would have when opening an app would be organizing instead of writing. 

With Supernotes I can easily just focus on each section of my long form writing at a time without dealing with plugins, without trying to figure out or learn why a plugin or theme is not working, or without dealing with syncing issues or having to learn some code in order to make a system that would help me focus on writing.
