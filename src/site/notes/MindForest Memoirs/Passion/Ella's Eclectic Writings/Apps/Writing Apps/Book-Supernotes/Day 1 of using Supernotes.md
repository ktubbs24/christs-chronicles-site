# Day 1 of using Supernotes

[[2023-04-25\|2023-04-25]]

> ***Written after the first day of using this app***

If most of my favorite apps that I have tried out had a baby it would be supernotes!!!  
Logseq + Obsidian + Gingkowriter + Tangent notes + Walling = Supernotes

I have only been using this app for about less than 24 hours and I quickly zoned out, made beautiful notes on what I was looking into and researching and thinking about, and the logging and visual look of everything is just masterful!

I donâ€™t think I have been this excited for an app that actually works WITH ME and my way of thinking since I discovered obsidian. Although my way of thinking reminds of me when I wrote this note about [[MindForest Memoirs/Passion/overbuilding in apps  like Notion and Obsidian\|overbuilding in apps  like Notion and Obsidian]].
