# Supernotes notes feed reminds me of a blogging feed 
[[2023-05-02\|2023-05-02]]

And it isÂ _perfect_Â since I am blogging and [[MindForest Memoirs/Passion/writing to publish\|writing to publish]] as a priority, so having my notes look like they are all coming through a feed vertically or having them spread out into columns just makes me so happy that I can reference all topic notes on any given topic I would be looking into all at once. ðŸ¤“ðŸ¤—
