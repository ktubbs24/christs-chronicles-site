God uses children to teach adults how to see: 

> [[MindForest Memoirs/Profession/Studies/Bible Study Kit (ESV)/Scripture (WEB)/46 - 1 Corinthians/1 Cor-01#v27\|1 Cor 1.27]] ...*but God chose the foolish things of the world that he might put to shame those who are wise. God chose the weak things of the world that he might put to shame the things that are strong.*  
> [[MindForest Memoirs/Profession/Studies/Bible Study Kit (ESV)/Scripture (WEB)/46 - 1 Corinthians/1 Cor-01#v28\|1 Cor 1.28]] *God chose the lowly things of the world, and the things that are despised, and the things that don't exist, that he might bring to nothing the things that exist. 

It is because when we are children, we don’t have the understanding of how evil this world is and the extent that we learn about this world and most people as we get older. And this is because experience. And with [[Experience is going to knowledge because experience is knowledge\|Experience is going to knowledge because experience is knowledge]]. 

But a child has just come into the world and has only been on the earth for a short time so they did not have a lot of experience which means they don’t have a lot of knowledge yet. And this is so good and beneficial in so many different ways there is more happiness And peace with less knowledge.

[[Adam and Eve were at peace when they did not have much knowledge\|Adam and Eve were at peace when they did not have much knowledge]] But it is also written in the scriptures that with much knowledge comes much grief And this is because [[Attaining more knowledge means there is always going to be bad knowledge present with the good knowledge\|Attaining more knowledge means there is always going to be bad knowledge present with the good knowledge]]. 
The father is unaffected by having supreme knowledge and understanding. But we, as human beings were designed to glorify God, which means we were only designed to understand and appreciate and see peace, love, truth And when we send against God to gain more knowledge and understanding on our own that led to being blind from focusing on our focal point had now been introduced to Disorderly chaos Which by definition distracts you from peace and completeness.

We see this with the world that we live in today with all the distractions at the enemy has placed to make us think that we are supposed to perform, do one another, one another, or try to be supreme in our own right and even think that we can be a God but We can’t even focus on the good things consistently without practicing and performing the bad While God does this effortlessly because it is who he is. 

But A child does not have the same amount of knowledge that adults have or even teenagers because they have not been in the world long enough to gain a lot of experience, which internally is gaining a lot of knowledge. 

And even if a child grow up with gaining positive knowledge and being in a positive environment and family, you will still suffer grief because we are a product of our environment in the world that we live in is going to have the bad knowledge that is going to come along with the good knowledge. This means believing in Jesus, it is inevitable and unavoidable to not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil because just living or rather existing on this earth  is going to result, and having to be forced fed from the enemy who will tempt the flesh of a child or an adult and on the vulnerability of the ignorance of less experience. 

This is also why Jesus, who is God, says that in order to see the kingdom of God you must be like a child. A child sees the good in people and not by choice but but design, appreciates joyful moments and family. A child naturally feels bad when they do bad and doesn’t try to mask this but is upset when they have upsetted their parent or guardian and they want to do right by them Because they would’ve realized that they would’ve caused this pleasure in their parents and so The child naturally wants To bring order back. To bring peace back unless the child is being taught by an unruly parent that chaos reigns in that household, and this is done when parents overstepped their authority, parents and rule givers And punishes a child prematurely, or just because of  displeasure. But A parent that Understands (As all understanding comes from above) That chaos is going to be the lesson that teaches the child and that will lead the child to want to come back to order Because at that point the parent Would be able to see the necessity of balance that comes with order and chaos and will be able to teach the child the way they should go so they will depart from it. 


So despite with many atheist think is the truth and many who lie and say that you’re born in atheist, the opposite is true. Everybody is born and comes directly from God, and it is in their purest state before entering into this world. And when I say entering, I even before entering the womb. This means that a child or a baby or a fetus is not or has not had contact or communication with the voice of the devil being spoken through that seduces and distract people from the voice of God in this world. Seduces and distracts people from focusing on [[MindForest Memoirs/zProduction/4-Summarizing/seeing the order in chaos\|seeing the order in chaos]]. Notice how an adult Who cannot see, God will ask the question of why does God allows such travesty to happen on this earth? And that showcases that they’re questioning is focused on their focal point if they were to ask the question, how does God maintain Order and sustain This planet, even though there is much travesty on this earth?; then that is where the question would be rooted and focused on order and on God.
