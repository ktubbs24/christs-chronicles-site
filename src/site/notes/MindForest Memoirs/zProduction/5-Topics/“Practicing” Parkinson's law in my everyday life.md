# “Practicing” Parkinson's law in my everyday life

> **Parkinson’s Law**: *The notion that work expands to fill the time available for its completion.* 

I heard about someone talking about Parkinson's law on a video today and even though I heard the term and concept before I had to revisit the meaning of Parkinson’s law just out of curiosity since I love [[MindForest Memoirs/Passion/Ella's Eclectic Writings/Productivity/Time-Management/Time-Management\|Time-Management]] — although I do believe that this “law” preceded Parkinson’s dissertations on the matter. 

## I have always functioned best when activities were placed in time slots in the day

I am always trying to find out different ways to make the best use of my time while working in many areas of online ministry production and when I looked over what Parkinson’s law meant in a little more depth then what I was familiar with; it was very interesting how I noticed that I had been practicing the concept most of my adult life already. 

Since my time in the Marines, I learned about myself that [[MindForest Memoirs/zProduction/4-Summarizing/I enjoy and work better under stress (eustress)\|I enjoy and work better under stress (eustress)]] and deadlines instead of free balling it and living vicariously through others and what normally comes with a spontaneity lifestyle. That type of lifestyle stresses me out in the worse way. 

In the past I remember that anytime  I needed or did get something done, I would get it done when I would assign/block time out of my day or when I used to work and clock in at my older jobs. 

## Parkinson’s Law in online ministry production

I still somewhat do this but since I’ve started to do this for ministry I have seen much more things getting completed. Now I keep a time sheet of the time tracked that I worked and focused on for a specific day. I love the feeling of clocking into whatever work I got that day and having a limited amount of time to do it. Doing this helps me to be able to complete multiple projects a day and just zone in and focus knowing that I [[MindForest Memoirs/zProduction/5-Topics/Time Budgeting is allowing me to intentionally make good use of my time while respecting and appreciating the time that God has blessed me with\|am intentionally making good use of my time while respecting and appreciating the time that God has blessed me with]] to do what I’m called to do *with* that time. 

I believe that functioning in high performance due to structure and routine is not a preference or personal conviction; as every human was made by [[MindForest Memoirs/zProduction/3-Emerged/God is a God of order and structure\| God who is a God of order and structure]]; but I don’t know…there are many people who [[MindForest Memoirs/zProduction/2-Reflection/exist without living\|exist without living]] and who waste their lives away having a [[MindForest Memoirs/zProduction/2-Reflection/carefree lifestyle and free spirit mentality\|carefree lifestyle and free spirit mentality]] so this would likely be a non issue for this that of person.
