# Time Budgeting is allowing me to intentionally make good use of my time while respecting and appreciating the time that God has blessed me with

Something that I’m learning about time budgeting while I’m practicing doing this and turning this into more of a hobby then a chore, is that when I am time budgeting it is like I am making a promise to myself or a commitment to myself and staying true to that commitment and to the time that I’m spending on whatever task I am budgeting and being responsible for.

It’s like telling myself that I’m going to be accountable for ’x’ amount of time that I’m given on this earth and then making good use of it and it all feels good because it’s like practicing the concept of [[MindForest Memoirs/zProduction/3-Emerged/Your word is your bond and so is God’s Word\| being a man of your words you were being your bond]]. 

No matter what activity or task I’m doing I feel great. I wouldn’t be surprised if there was a  dopamine hit that is released when sitting down and budgeting my time and making sure I am committed to fulfilling the task at hand *while* doing so.  

Time budgeting is also has helping me to be more present and intentional about whatever I’m giving my time toward. I’m able to really sit and think if something is worth my time which has led me to not really waste time on things that are trivial, unproductive, and busy work that is unfruitful.
