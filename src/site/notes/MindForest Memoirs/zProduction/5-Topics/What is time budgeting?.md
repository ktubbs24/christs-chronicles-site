Time budgeting is the practice of tracking your time using a logbook or, as I prefer to do, using a app to clock in when you start focusing on a specific task and/or to clock your time on how long you are taking to do regular chores or activities. Afterwards you would have a review process to go back through the time logs and see where you can save time according to the budget you set for yourself on how you want your time to be spent. 

This is a new hobby of mine that I really enjoy.  

This is a tool to helps me to not be distracted for long periods of my time if at all and helps me to fulfill the scriptures: 

> [[MindForest Memoirs/_META_/Bible Study Kit (ESV)/Scripture (WEB)/49 - Ephesians/Ephes-05#v15\|Ephes 5,15-17]] *Therefore watch carefully how you walk, not as unwise, but as wise,  redeeming the time, because the days are evil.  Therefore don't be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.*  [[MindForest Memoirs/_META_/Bible Study Kit (ESV)/Scripture (WEB)/49 - Ephesians/Ephes-05#v16\|Ephes-05#v16]][[MindForest Memoirs/_META_/Bible Study Kit (ESV)/Scripture (WEB)/49 - Ephesians/Ephes-05#v17\|Ephes-05#v17]]
