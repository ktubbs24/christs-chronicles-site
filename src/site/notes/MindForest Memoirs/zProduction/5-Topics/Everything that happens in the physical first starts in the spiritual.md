# Everything that happens in the physical first starts in the spiritual

Everything that happens in the physical and seen world first starts in the spiritual and unseen world. 
This is because every decision that we make is a judgment and a judgment, whether that be good or bad, is a judgment that only first existed as an idea (thought, concept) which would come first or pre-exist before the idea has been decided upon and acted out. 

Ideas are unseen and can not be touched but exist spiritually and have existed spiritually long before a person "caught" the pre-existent idea and acted upon it. Despite what the world teaches, ideas do not start with an individual which is why we see the same ideas being "rediscovered" and repeated throughout the course of human history internationally.

This is also why [[MindForest Memoirs/zProduction/2-Reflection/no one is a creator but God alone\| no one is a creator but only God is THE Creator]] despite how social media and the internet is calling everyone [[MindForest Memoirs/zProduction/3-Emerged/influencers and content creators\|influencers and content creators]] which just showcases the backwardsness of the world that is in opposition towards God.

Everything comes from [[God is Spirit \| God (who is Spirit)]] and who starts all things and while He is Spirit His creation represents Him in how everything starts spiritually before it is manifested or given fruition physically to be physically seen.
