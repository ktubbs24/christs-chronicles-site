# Staying away from not being too close to people who do not have structure in their life

[[MindForest Memoirs/zProduction/3-Emerged/How can two walk together unless they are in agreement\|How can two walk together unless they are in agreement]]? I am not and can not be in agreement both physically and spiritually with someone who is not in agreement with structure and routines which is also someone that is not in agreement with [[God is a God of order and structure \| God who IS Order and Structure]] by default.

Being too close to someone that is not working on improving themselves and who has not routine will  interfere with my structure and routines because it would first start with me allowing, enabling, and endorsing them to be around me while I tolerate their behavior which is a sign of self-disrespect. Like I would literally be dissing myself.  

Then that entire relationship, companionship, or friendship would be built on disrespect and built on me lying to myself and lying to the other person who would be lying to themselves already as they would be thinking and acting on the premise that [[MindForest Memoirs/zProduction/1-idea/carefree lifestyle and free spirit mentality\|having a structure free and nonconsequencial ]] lifestyle is good when it's not. 

So once tolerance has become accepted then so will everything else that I don't align with become accepted as well and this would be no fault of no one but myself if I allow this because I would have first been out of order with God who tells us to[[Guarding your heart \| guard your heart for everything you do flows from it]]; so allowing someone that is not in alignment with His just showcasing how I was not first aligned with God first to tolerate disorder and that is not acceptable. 

Of course I can and still will communicate with a disorderly person because seeds of influence towards Christ needs to happen as [[You are the light of the world \| we are the light of the world when we have believed in Jesus]] but I do not have to, desire to, or need to let this type of person close to my heart for any reason. Doing so is directly being disobedient to Jesus because [[God is a God of order and structure \|God who is order and structure does not let the disorderly close to His heart]] and to be Holy as He is Holy is to be the same [[MindForest Memoirs/zProduction/3-Emerged/Jesus is the Way\| Way]]. 

Some people may call it "ghosting" but I call it [[God is the Holy Ghost \| Holy Ghosting]]!
