# I've been feeling more fulfilled at the end of the day with time budgeting

When you have decided that on certain days of the week you want to do xyz and it very easy to say no to people and things that aren’t as important to give your *time* to. And you won’t *spend* time on mediocre things which leads to a more fulfilling day and productive day versus barely getting by and always feeling anxious, late, or pulled around in multiple directions, falling into others *time budget* instead of your own. 

As I mentioned in [[MindForest Memoirs/zProduction/5-Topics/Budget your time like you would budget your finances\|Budget your time like you would budget your finances]], when you have a personal time budget it is easier for you to not waste time on non important tasks and while I have been practicing time budgeting these past two weeks or so, I’ve been noticing how fulfilled I am in having an accomplished feeling at the end of everyday. 

I believe this is because budgeting my time has led for me to not only be more intentional about my actions but also led me to be more responsible and accountable for keeping my promises that I make to myself which would be a promise entailing what I want to do that day. 

And so at the end of the day when the task was completed (*or even if it wasn’t that’s okay because it was still worked on*) then when I reflect on and review my day at the end of the day I feel like I kept my promise to myself which means I enforced and protected a personal boundary of mine, practiced integrity on top of respecting myself, and I leveled up for doing so. 

All of this now that I think about it is practicing righteousness while I’m in Christ because to redeem the time, be vigilant about your time and others, practicing integrity and discipline while maintaining my boundaries which is also guarding your heart as God says; are all fruits of practicing righteousness. This is likely why I feel fulfilled at the end of the day because I’m practicing everyday to give all of my time to my Father in heaven and He is the One who fulfills our life with purpose and contentment while also only through God can anyone be successful! 

So this is all fun and amazing peeling the layers back and reflecting and seeing how God is teaching me while I’m working and being protective of my life and time day to day.
