# Structure and routines are the foundation and backbone of systems
Related:: [[MindForest Memoirs/zProduction/5-Topics/I need structures and routines in my life\|I need structures and routines in my life]]

Without structure in my life it is like not having a foundation or no backbone. 

## Our body is a huge representation of systems comprises of multiple structures that functions off of daily bodily routines 

Our Body has the skeletal system that is our body's structure to hold all of the organs, ligaments, and muscles in place. With our bodies having a skeletal system that functions as our structure, the human body also makes a *routine* of doing its daily functions; even involuntary functions that we donâ€™t have any control over; in order to keep the body living, detoxing, and performing whatever daily bodily functions it performs.

When we are operating in systems and routines then we are aligning to our body's design which functions off of routines and systems without our input most of the time.
