# I need structures and routines in my life

Related:: [[MindForest Memoirs/zProduction/3-Emerged/I function more efficiently in systems\|I function more efficiently in systems]]

I have noticed that I function best with structure and routines. I don’t have to have a rigid or strict schedule because I know that that’s impossible and if I am not careful I can set myself up for giving myself a false sense of control over my life. I can’t control outside circumstances. 

God controls all circumstances in my life since He: 
- *Is* control 
- [[MindForest Memoirs/zProduction/3-Emerged/God orders all of our steps\|Orders all of our steps]]
- numbers our days
- see also: [[MindForest Memoirs/zProduction/3-Emerged/God is a God of order and structure\|God is a God of order and structure]]

But regardless, even with having a loose structure that is all I would need so that I could practice intentionality every day and be consistent and committed to whatever it is I need to do which in turn leads to helping me to grow to be a better steward of my time and my body and to be used by God to nurture others in His garden/harvest.
