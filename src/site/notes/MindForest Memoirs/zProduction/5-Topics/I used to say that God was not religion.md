# I used to say that God was not religion 

But religion is not evil when it comes from God because only that which is pure comes from Him. Religions of this world that tries to imitate Him *WITHOUT* Him are obviously impure because this very act is the same as when [[MindForest Memoirs/zProduction/2-Reflection/no one is a creator but God alone\|people pridefully try to be like God]].

Religion from the devil is going to be evil because [[MindForest Memoirs/zProduction/3-Emerged/the devil is the father of lies\|the devil is the father of lies]]. 

I used to say Jesus is not a religion, but that was based on my only understanding of what religion was at the time which were the false ones coming from the world. So when I used to say that Jesus was not a religion, I was also saying that Jesus was not false like the false religions of the world. I was disassociating myself from what was false and doing the same thing with disassociating Jesus from religion; but now I know better and that because Jesus is pure and undefiled, and He is not of this world, then a religion that puts Him FIRST and not a church or tradition first is also going to be the same. Mankind make their own religions because people who hate God will worship their own idea of "god" religion.

But religion in and of itself is not evil. People with evil hearts defile religion that first came from God above:

> [[MindForest Memoirs/_META_/Bible Study Kit (ESV)/Scripture (WEB)/59 - James/James-01#v27\|James 1.27]] *Pure religion and undefiled before our God and Father is this: to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unstained by the world.* 

The only time when religion is pure and faultless is when it is coming from Jesus, who is pure and faultless. Notice that this type of religion can only be coming from Jesus and NOT Christianity, which comes from mankind's traditions. 

Also, the only [[MindForest Memoirs/zProduction/3-Emerged/Jesus is the Way\|way]] that we are not polluted by this world is after we would have left it when Jesus calls us out of this world when He saves us through us believing in Him. The religious acts that God accepts only happen AFTER you first believe in Him, and not before. This is why many won't make it to heaven even though they are considered "religious" by the world. It is because they made religion their idol and not Jesus and God is a jealous God, there is no competition with Him!
