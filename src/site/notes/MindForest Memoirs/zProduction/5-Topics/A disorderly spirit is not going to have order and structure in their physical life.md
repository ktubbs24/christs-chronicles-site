# A disorderly spirit is not going to have order and structure in their physical life
Related:: [[MindForest Memoirs/zProduction/5-Topics/I need structures and routines in my life\|I need structures and routines in my life]]

This is because [[MindForest Memoirs/zProduction/5-Topics/Everything that happens in the physical first starts in the spiritual\|Everything that happens in the physical first starts in the spiritual]] so when someone: 
- has a disordered lifestyle
- makes disorderly choices
- is not on a decent routine
- does not have structure in their life (little to, if at all) 

then they are first spiritually out of alignment with [[God is Spirit \| God who is Spirit]] and they will in turn be disorderly internally in *their* spirit (because being out of step with God who is order is the definition of disorder) and the result is seen in a person not "*having their life together*". 

These are sadly the types of people who are being [[influencers and content creators \| influenced]] by evil spirits who by default are perverted, disorderly, and who causes anxiety because they are in rebellion to God, being in rebellion to order. This is one of MANY reasons for why it is so important [[to believe in Jesus, who is God, is believing in order and structure \| to believe in Jesus, who is God, because doing so is believing in order]].
