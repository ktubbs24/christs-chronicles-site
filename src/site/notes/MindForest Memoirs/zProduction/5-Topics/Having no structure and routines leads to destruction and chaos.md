Whenever there is no structure or routine this is when chaos ensues. Having no structure or routines is like inviting for there to be destruction.

*I mean the word, destruction almost seems to expose what the verb is doing:*
- DeSTRUCTion 
- *De* means to undo, remove, separate
- STRUCT found in structure where structure is the action of building, form of organization, construction 
- So destruction = to dethrone or to tear down a structure.

Without having structures and routines, whenever chaos comes you won't be able to endure and manage anything and you would have no foundation to stand or fall back on when faced against the tides so itâ€™s like constantly being thrown against the wall or going along with anything that is thrown at you because you would not have a starting point *to get back to*, to rebuild or to reset. 

This leads to future destruction and chaos.
